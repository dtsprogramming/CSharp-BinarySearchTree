# CSharp-BinarySearchTree
 A simple BST console application coded in C#

 Current program allows
 - Inserting Node Values
 - Removing Node Values
 - Generating a tree from the Node Values entered
 - Generating a random tree (by node count)
 - Exiting the program

 After inserting node values and generating a tree, the program will display the Nodes, as they were entered, followed by an In-Order traversal of the BST (left-root-right). Finally, the program will display the tree structure (rotated counter-clockwise by 90 deg).
